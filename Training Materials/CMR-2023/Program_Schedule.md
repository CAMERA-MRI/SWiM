# SCAN WITH ME (SWiM) 2023 Program Schedule

The 2023 SWiM Program focused on cardiac MRI (CMR) scanning. All training, including live demos on CMR, were delivered through the SWiM Program training platform (https://event.fourwaves.com/swim). The course materials available on this repository are those approved to be publicly shared by the faculty.  

**Program Objectives:**
1. Build standard skills in MR imaging techniques.
2. Upscale and advance the MRI knowledge of technologists practicing in resource limited settings.
3. Implement standard MRI protocols and best practices adapted for optimal imaging in resource limited settings. 
4. Train and retrain imaging experts who will sustainably advance the practice of MRI in LMICs.
5. Create a collaborative culture and a network of imaging experts in LMICs. 

**Program Structure:** The program was completed in 3 modules

1. **Teach - Two-weeks Virtual Foundation Course on CMR. (August 22nd to September 2nd, 2023) - 20 hrs.**  
Learn the basics.   Two-week self-paced online learning experience supported by live tutorials on Saturdays to discover fundamentals in MR imaging and image analysis relevant to CMR.    
2. **Try - Two Week Hybrid Observership (September 5th to September 16th, 2023) - 20 hrs.**  
Scan with an expert. Observe live demos with a team of expert technologists and try out your hands on acquiring high quality images, analyze images, and explore advanced MRI (e.g., BMORE) techniques. This is supported by daily seminars, networking opportunities, and team building capstone projects. The seminars provide conceptual information on CMR, focusing on image quality and the role of CMR for the indication. The capstone projects enabled each team to work together to address one goal (e.g., optimize protocols or work on case reports).   
3. **Use - Two weeks Practicum (September 26th to October 7th, 2023) - 16 hrs.**  
Scan as an expert. Apply skills gained during the foundation and observership modules and to scan 1-2 volunteers or cardiac patients on your scanner. This module is supported by hands-on best practices demonstrations to help learners apply their skills. Teams work together to implement the imaging protocol they reviewed for their capstone project on their scanner and present their case report.
