# Scan With Me (SWiM) Protocols

We offers the protocols created by SWiM Program participants, as part of their training. The protocols are released at the end of each SWiM Program and are tailored to each program's subject area. Our aim is to make these protocols accessible to radiographers in low- to middle-income countries, enhancing the availability of specialized sequences and raising global imaging standards.
 

These MRI protocols were optimized to deliver the highest-achievable imaging quality and contrast for imaging in resource limited settings. They are customized for the MR scanner on which they were created, and we aspire to expand this protocol database through future SWiM Programs. 

If you'd like to contribute to our database by sharing your MR protocols for your scanner, please contact us at https://www.cameramriafrica.org/contact
